This solution prevents deadlocks and the race condtion using mutexes and semaphores, the f array is an array full of semaphores that represent each chopstick.
Only one philosopher may pick up chopsticks at a time, all other philosophers are locked behind the mutex lock until both chopsticks have been taken.
If a philosopher attempts to pick up a chopstick that has already been taken by another philosopher, they must wait inside the critical section for the chopstick to be put down. 
This means that the critical section stays locked until the philosopher has taken both chopsticks.
This is what prevents the deadlock of all philosophers having only one chopstick.
